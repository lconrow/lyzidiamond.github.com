    Lyzi Diamond | April 24, 2013
  </section>

  <p><em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking a lot, but you&rsquo;re not saying anything.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t mean to mimic David Byrne, but his exhausted, frustrated, post-argument comment could have just as easily been from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_Killer">Talking Heads 1977* classic</a>. He could have just as easily been on stage in the big suit, limping around to new wave beats (or no-wave non-beats), full of vigor that would inspire a generation, and generations to come.</p>

<p>But there was no stage, no lights, no big suit. He was laying in bed, half-asleep, irritated and exasperated and out of options. I had spend the last hour, like I&rsquo;ve spent many hours as of late, beating up his girlfriend, calling her names, making her feel small and inadequate. He was sick of it. He wanted it to stop. I was hurting someone he loves.</p>

<p>His girlfriend is me, and I have a lot of trouble keeping my head above water when it comes to my skills, my aspirations, and, ultimately, my options. I don&rsquo;t ever feel like I have what it takes to succeed because of various talents I don&rsquo;t possesses. Because I have an idea of what I want that is arbitrary and societal and fabricated, and it&rsquo;s not who I am or what I&rsquo;m good at, and that makes it hard for the brain to cope with.</p>

<p>So he did what he had to do. He did his best to get me out of it.</p>

<p>In truth, he didn&rsquo;t say the line <em>exactly</em> as written by Byrne and Frantz and Weymouth; he didn&rsquo;t mean to make me the victim and him the killer. What he said was:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;You talk about all these things, but you never actually <strong>do</strong> anything.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I thought about this a lot last night as I laid awake for hours, pondering. It took me a while, but I realized that he was right. I don&rsquo;t take the time, I don&rsquo;t sit down and churn things out. I know that to get better you need to practice, so why don&rsquo;t I practice? Why don&rsquo;t I work? Why don&rsquo;t I <em>try?</em></p>

<p>There it was. <em>That</em> was the lightbulb. I don&rsquo;t try! I&rsquo;m so afraid of failure that I don&rsquo;t even try in the first place. I dismiss options outright because of a fear that I will have an option taken away from me.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker, and something I am slowly realizing. The worst thing to happen if I try and fail is&hellip; that I try something else. And if that doesn&rsquo;t work? Try something else. It&rsquo;s <em>okay</em> that I don&rsquo;t know what I want to do, and it&rsquo;s <em>okay</em> to have a ton of interests. And it&rsquo;s even okay to be bad at things, and to still like them! But the more days that go by with me beating myself for not being a good cartographer and not having a good portfolio that I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> work on a map? That I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> try? I&rsquo;m setting myself up for failure. I&rsquo;m stacking the deck. I will always lose.</p>

<p>When I was 12 I started playing bass. I wanted to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Deal">Kim Deal</a>, I wanted to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27arcy_Wretzky">D'arcy Wretzky</a>, I wanted to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Gordon">Kim Gordon</a>, I wanted to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Foster">Kathy Foster</a>. And I wanted to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Weymouth">Tina Weymouth</a>, too. Should I keep beating myself up for not being a bassist in a successful band? For not being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimee_Mann">Aimee Mann</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanza_Spalding">Esperanza Spalding</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathi_Wilcox">Kathi Wilcox</a>?**</p>

<p>Hell no. I&rsquo;m going to keep playing music, I&rsquo;m going to keep making maps and writing Python scrapers and riding bikes and planning events. I&rsquo;m Lyzi Diamond, and so long as I try, that can mean whatever I want it to mean.</p>

<p><em>*&ldquo;Psycho Killer&rdquo; was first performed in 1974 by the Talking Heads precursor The Artistic, then in 1975 by the Talking Heads, and finally recorded for the 1977 album, Talking Heads: 77. This note is in place specifically because I know my friends are the ones to nitpick. And that&rsquo;s why I love them. :)</em></p>

<p><em>**If you can name the bands that all of these women were in without clicking the links, you should email me, and we should be friends.</em></p>
