  <p><em>The other day, my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/allafarce">Dave</a> asked me, &ldquo;Okay. So what does <a href="http://tilemill.com">TileMill</a> <strong>actually do</strong>?&rdquo; This was my response (with the curse words edited out, and a few links thrown in). I was told it&rsquo;d be useful to people. Enjoy!</em></p>

<p>TileMill allows you to load in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats#Vector_formats">vector</a> and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats#Raster_formats">raster</a> data, style it using a language called <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/">CartoCSS</a> (often abbreviated &ldquo;carto&rdquo;), and export raster <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles">map tiles</a>. Map tiles can be exported as PNG, SVG, or <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/">MBTiles</a>, which is <a href="http://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>&rsquo;s format. TileMill also allows you to add feature layers on top of your tiles, which are vector layers that have some sort of interactivity (tooltips, for example).</p>

<p>TileMill only allows you to have one interactivity/feature layer at a time. Typically the interaction involves tooltips. That&rsquo;s the basic interactivity functionality built in to TileMill (you can do more stuff in <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a>, as I&rsquo;m sure you know). Because you&rsquo;re loading in (mostly) vector layers that have a lot of data associated with them (attributes/properties/columns in a database table/whatever else you want to call it), you can pull from that data to make individualized tooltips without hardcoding them. There&rsquo;s more info on how to do that <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/tooltips/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Styling vector layers is also a pretty cool thing that can pull from attribute information &ndash; if you wanted to make <a href="http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Graduated_Symbols">graduated symbols</a> based on the values of some attribute, you can do that within CartoCSS. There&rsquo;s a lot of functionality there. You can read more about styling in TileMill <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The bread and butter of TileMill is obviously tiles. It seems really trivial, right? Why can&rsquo;t I just draw some crap on some images and put those images in a map? There are a few reasons.</p>

<p>A map tile is a very specific thing. Map tiles are 256x256 pixel images that are placed side by side inside of a web map to give the illusion of one very large, seamless image. Maps have specific zoom levels that are explicitly defined, from zoom level 0 through zoom level 20. Zoom level 0 is one tile for the whole world. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/zoom0.png" class="inline"></p>

<p>Zoom level 1 is four tiles for the whole world, in a 2x2 grid. Zoom level 2 is 16 tiles for the whole world, in a 4x4 grid. You see where this is going.</p>

<p>Zoom levels are the same across all tilesets. Zoom level 0 is always going to be one tile for the world, 1 will be four tiles, etc. You can imagine that the whole world at zoom level 20 gets pretty unwieldy. It&rsquo;s a <strong>lot</strong> of data. When you&rsquo;re zoomed way in and panning around a map, only the tiles that are being viewed are rendered, and then cached. It&rsquo;s actually quite efficient and does create the illusion of a seamless image, because you are only ever rendering a subset of the tiles, which doesn&rsquo;t take very long.</p>

<p>The URL for the tile above is http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/lyzidiamond.map-ietb6srb/0/0/0.png. The first part is obviously the server. The last three numbers, as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve figured out, delineate the zoom level and the x/y location of that particular tile in the grid. Zoom 0 is a pretty bad example of this. Let&rsquo;s go to zoom 1.</p>

<p><img src="/images/zoom-1-1-0.png" class="inline"></p>

<p>This is the tile in the first row in the second column of the zoom level 1 2x2 grid. Its URL is http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/lyzidiamond.map-ietb6srb/1/1/0.png. You can see that at the end of the URL, it shows us that we&rsquo;re looking at a tile from zoom level 1 in the 1, 0 part of the grid.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tilegrid.png" class="inline"></p>

<p>Two more, way zoomed in, just for fun:</p>

<p><img src="/images/zoom-12-1009-1878.png" class="inline"></p>

<p>URL: http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/lyzidiamond.map-ietb6srb/12/1009/1878.png</p>

<p><img src="/images/zoom-12-1009-1879.png" class="inline"></p>

<p>URL: http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/lyzidiamond.map-ietb6srb/12/1009/1879.png, or the tile right below the previous one. Get it? Pretty cool, right?</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;ve now deduced that there&rsquo;s a pretty rigorous file structure that is required to manage all of this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tile-files.png" class="inline"></p>

<p>Notice that in this image, it doesn&rsquo;t have every zoom level, or even the entirety of the grid. TileMill will ask you for a) a geographic area and b) the number of zoom levels you want before you export. If you&rsquo;re trying to do something too epically large, or with a ton of layers that are going to be annoying/resource-consuming to render down, it&rsquo;ll give you a nice little warning, along the lines of &ldquo;HEY JERKFACE WE DON&rsquo;T WANNA DO THAT FIX YR STUFF.&rdquo; But nicer. Then they export your tiles into this file structure, and indeed host them as well. If they&rsquo;re hosting a ton of your crap or you&rsquo;re getting a ton of views, they ask you to pay them.</p>

<p>(Mostly, these are PNGs. Mapbox likes its MBTiles format for a bunch of reasons, one of which is that some tiles [particularly in the middle of water bodies] are always going to look the same, at every zoom level and in any location. You can read them loving on it more <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/">here</a>.)</p>

<p><em>(Editor&rsquo;s note: the original version of the following paragraph was incorrect, so I&rsquo;ve included an updated version here.)</em></p>

<p>Okay, on to <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vector_tiles">vector tiles</a>. <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/vector-tiles/">Vector tiles</a> use data structure magic (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers">protocol buffers</a>) to store all sorts of information you&rsquo;d have in a geographic vector data layer and then renders it into images on the fly. This makes it really awesomely space-efficient; the entirety of <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>&rsquo;s data as vector tiles can fit on just about 60GB, <a href="https://vine.co/v/b0DvTPnpPtw">small enough to fit on a thumb drive</a>.</p>

<p>Vector tiles are going to be a part of TileMill2 when it&rsquo;s released, which will also come pre-loaded with the whole world in OSM vectors. Seriously. Mapbox is maybe the coolest company ever of ever.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I missed some stuff. Let me know if you have any other questions. Sorry I wrote an essay, but that&rsquo;s kind of what I do.</p>
