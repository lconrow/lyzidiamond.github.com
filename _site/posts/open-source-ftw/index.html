  <p>For some time, I&rsquo;ve been frustrated with the lack of social spaces for developers to work together on map-related projects here in Portland. There are <a href="http://calagator.org">language-specific meetups</a>, and there are definitely people hacking on spatial projects at those, but it&rsquo;s in the context of the programming language, not the field of geospatial tech. I have also long been fascinated with the pedagogical issues of teaching developers about geographic principles and geographers about computer programming. I began wondering: is there a place for a meetup like this in Portland?</p>

<p>At some point during this thought process, I discovered <a href="http://twitter.com/maptimesf">MaptimeSF</a>, a weekly map hack night run by a few of the excellent folks over at <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen</a> in San Francsico. I heard that there were a couple similar groups popping up around the country, so I decided to get in contact about starting one in Portland. Thus was born <a href="http://twitter.com/maptimepdx">MaptimePDX</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>MaptimePDX is ON! Sunday 9/29, 1pm-4pm at Flux (<a href="http://t.co/aYGp0GPG3E">http://t.co/aYGp0GPG3E</a>), part of <a href="https://twitter.com/WhereCampPDX">@WhereCampPDX</a>. EXCITED!

<p>This past weekend was <a href="http://wherecamppdx.org">WhereCampPDX</a>, which seemed like the perfect time to hold the inaugural MaptimePDX event. In addition to hosting an open hack for anyone who was interested in joining us, I prepared a little exercise I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write for a while. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://github.com/lyzidiamond/learn-geojson">Learn GeoJSON</a>, and its goal is to teach about the principles and ideas of <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a>, <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, and <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> without having to lead beginners through dealing with (a) code and (b) the command line. You can view the slides I used for my presentation <a href="http://lyzidiamond.com/learn-geojson/">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Who&#39;s excited for <a href="https://twitter.com/MaptimePDX">@MaptimePDX</a> today? I am! I&#39;m also frantically finishing up the exercise we&#39;re going to do :-P</p>&mdash; Lyzi Diamond (@lyzidiamond) <a href="https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond/statuses/384381323470577665">September 29, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>The basic idea is to use GitHub as a collaboration tool for building crowd-sourced geographic (GeoJSON) datasets with the help of the excellent <a href="http://geojson.io">geojson.io</a>. Essentially, users fork the original (my) repo, open their desired geojson files using geojson.io (which gives them the option of clicking back and forth between a table-based format and GeoJSON format — hooray unintentional learning tools!), add some points visually, commit to their repo, and make a pull request back to the original repo. (Further information and more detailed instructions are available on the README in the <a href="http://github.com/lyzidiamond/learn-geojson">GitHub repo</a>. I also intend on writing a blog post about it once it&rsquo;s totally done, so look out for that.) It actually went pretty smoothly up to that point, which was awesome!</p>

<p>Then I turned back to the projector to show an example of merging a pull request, seeing as I had about ten of them at that point, and lo and behold&hellip;</p>

<h1><img src="https://raw.github.com/lyzidiamond/lyzidiamond.github.com/master/images/mergeconflict.png" class="inline" width="100%"></h1>


<p>Every pull request had a merge conflict! I got super frustrated, asked the group to talk amongst themselves, and investigated a little bit. When I checked the diff, this is what I saw:</p>

<h1><img src="https://raw.github.com/lyzidiamond/lyzidiamond.github.com/master/images/diff.png" class="inline" width="100%"></h1>


<p>Every feature in the dataset was on the same line! JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t care about line breaks, so this is definitely acceptable and is totally still valid GeoJSON, but makes it near impossible for use with this collaboration technique I was preaching. I didn&rsquo;t even notice it beforehand, because it appears to be line broken in geojson.io:</p>

<h1><img src="https://raw.github.com/lyzidiamond/lyzidiamond.github.com/master/images/geojsonio.png" class="inline" width="100%"></h1>


<p>A conundrum, to be certain. I thought to myself, &ldquo;Ugh, I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t figure this out ahead of time. How could I screw this up so badly?&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty scene.</p>

<p>But fortunately, I was surrounded by a few of the <a href="http://twitter.com/reidab">great</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/pdxmele">geo hackers</a> I had been so eager to recruit to MaptimePDX. And they said, &ldquo;You know, geojson.io is an open source project. We can just add some code to implement line breaks, make a pull request, and see if it gets merged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they did. And less than an hour later&hellip;</p>

<h1><img src="https://raw.github.com/lyzidiamond/lyzidiamond.github.com/master/images/merged.png" class="inline" width="100%"></h1>


<p>It was merged! Mele checked it afterwards, and it <a href="https://github.com/pdxmele/pdxpyconmap/commit/7890ee0924e987eda955c6218d95778026fd9384">totally works</a>:</p>

<h1><img src="https://raw.github.com/lyzidiamond/lyzidiamond.github.com/master/images/melecommit.png" class="inline" width="100%"></h1>


<p>Now, save for having to resolve the conflicts with each of the commits made pre-prettifying, this exercise will work completely smoothly in the future. I can&rsquo;t wait to present it again.</p>

<p><strong>This is a long story.</strong></p>

<p>But everyone has one of these stories — stories that make them realize what&rsquo;s been right in front of them the whole time. And this is mine: <strong>open source is the future.</strong> I&rsquo;m hooked. I&rsquo;m completely and totally hooked. I think Mele put it best:</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s contribute to all the things!</strong></p>

<p>Non sequiturs: Sometime soon I&rsquo;ll write a more in-depth post discussing the <a href="http://github.com/lyzidiamond/learn-geojson">Learn GeoJSON</a> exercise, how it works, what needs to be added to it, and how it may solve some of the pedagogical problems with getting geographers into tech. On a similar note, I hosted an unconference session at WhereCampPDX about geospatial pedagogy that yielded an interesting discussion. I&rsquo;ll write about that here, too.</p>
