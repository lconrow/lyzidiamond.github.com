  <p>Last week was the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/">2014 Code for America Summit</a>, and it was just as incredible as I imagined it would be. I was there last year, but this was <em>my</em> summit. <em>I</em> would be on stage presenting my work. <em>I</em> would be the one talking to next year&rsquo;s fellows, assuring them that it&rsquo;s a struggle, but it&rsquo;s worth it. <em>I</em> would be the one feeling confident.</p>

<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t feeling confident. Not even a little bit.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I was <em>terrified</em>. This was supposed to be <em>my</em> summit, and what had I accomplished? I stood next to my fellow fellows at the Civic Tech Fair showing off a <a href="http://streetscope.net">tiny application</a> that I only had a small hand in building, while everyone else was showing off projects they had worked on, projects that actually touched people and changed their lives. What had I done? What had I accomplished? I left that night dejected and disappointed in myself.</p>

<p>I carried these feelings with me back to the summit on Wednesday afternoon, when <a href="http://twitter.com/lippytak">Jake Solomon</a> delivered a talk onstage about the applications being developed by the health team at Code for America. His talk was called <strong>The Big Thing About Small Things.</strong></p>

<p>Those beautiful slides (made by my lovely roommate <a href="http://twitter.com/mollyampersand">Molly McLeod</a>) and Jake&rsquo;s words were making an excellent point: <em>sometimes it&rsquo;s the smallest things that make the biggest impact</em>. I thought about this as I walked out of the theater to prepare for my own talk, to be given on the same stage several hours later.</p>

<p>I ran into my fellow fellow <a href="http://twitter.com/davidleonardii">David Leonard</a>, and he and I went to grab a cup of coffee. In all of my pre-talk anxiety, I let it slip that I was feeling completely lost. I asked him, &ldquo;What have I accomplished this year? I feel like I haven&rsquo;t built anything, like I haven&rsquo;t done anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me with wide eyes and replied, &ldquo;Lyzi, are you kidding me? You have contributed to almost every single fellowship project &ndash; and some staff projects too! Without you, half of these projects would not be successful today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why hadn&rsquo;t I thought about it that way? Because that&rsquo;s not how we think about things. Most people think the important things they do are the big things, the obvious things. But sometimes it&rsquo;s the <em>small</em> things that make the biggest difference.</p>

<p>Think back to the last time you fixed a typo in a friend&rsquo;s email before she sent it, or when you stopped your mom from putting salt into the pan instead of sugar. Think about the typos you&rsquo;ve fixed on random GitHub repos and the explanations you&rsquo;ve made to your coworkers about how HTTP works, or what a map projection is, or why you need to use curly braces in JavaScript. Think about all of the tiny contributions you&rsquo;ve made to big projects.</p>

<p><strong>You made a difference!</strong> You may have thought your edits were small and your contributions insignificant, but that errant semicolon may have made or broken that application. And <em>you&rsquo;re</em> the one who found it.</p>

<p>After I talked to David, my mood totally flipped. (And then I got on stage and did a presentation, which gave me an adrenaline rush. that probably helped too. :-P) I started to notice all of the small contributions that every Code for America fellow makes to everyone else&rsquo;s project. All of the design meetups, portfolio and code reviews, brainstorming and namestorming sessions (ask <a href="http://twitter.com/ainsleywagon">Ainsley</a> about that one). All of the feedback and knowledge sharing and the way we&rsquo;ve held each other up all year.</p>

<p>The number one thing I learned from the Code for America Summit (and the number one thing I learned from this year as a CfA fellow) is the power of combining skills and sharing knowledge. The smallest things can be big things. You might not see it right away, but <strong>you are making a difference.</strong> Keep it up: your contribution may be the piece that solves the puzzle!</p>

<p><em>If this post inspired you to start contributing to projects on GitHub (even if it&rsquo;s just editing typos in READMEs, which is super helpful btw), but you&rsquo;re not sure how to start, check out <a href="http://github.com/lyzidiamond/learn-geojson">learn-geojson</a>, a tutorial for getting started with git and GitHub. Or just <a href="mailto:lyzidiamond@gmail.com">email me</a> and I&rsquo;ll point you in the right direction. :)</em></p>
