title: 'The Skilled Pedestrian'
---

<blockquote>
  <p>The pedestrian is a social being: he is also a transportation unit, and a marvelously complex and efficient one. He is self-contained, self-propelled, and moves forward with a field of vision about 100 degrees wide, further widening this with back-and-forth scanning movements to almost 180 degrees. He monitors a host of equations: two crossing patterns at left front, 290 feet a minute, three on the right, angle on the cars 30 degrees and closing, a pair abreast dead ahead, a traffic light starting to flash DONâ€™T WALK. In fractions of a second he responds with course shifts, accelerations, and retards, and he signals to others that he is doing so. Think of the orders and computers it would take to match him! Transportation engineers are spending millions on developing automated people-mover systems. But the best, by far, is a person.</p>
