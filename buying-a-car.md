title: Buying a car

1. Figure out what is important to you about your car. NOTE: there is no right answer here. For example, I really cared about having a sunroof. I know in Oregon that’s kind of silly, but it really mattered to me. Build your dream vehicle.
	- Manual vs automatic?
	- New vs. pre-owned vs. used (private dealer)?
	- Sedan, SUV, minivan, hatchback, convertible?
	- Do you care how powerful the engine is?
	- Sound system/internal controls?
	- Electric, hybrid?
	- “Fit and finish” features — automatic windows/locks, heated seats, storage space?
2. Figure out how much you can afford to pay. Most auto loans are anywhere from 36 to 60 months, with anywhere between 0% and 20% APR. APR is the loan interest — it gets added as a lump sum to the amount of money you will owe. The better your credit, the lower your APR will be. Your monthly payment is the total amount of your loan divided by the number of months.
	- How much money do you have for a down payment?
	- What is the monthly amount you are willing to pay?
	- Do you want to forego the financing process and pay up front for a car? If so, what is the maximum amount you can afford?
3. When you know the amount of money you want to pay (either monthly or up front), do some quick math to determine what a reasonable total amount is for you. I’ll give you my math for example:
	- I knew I had $3000 to put as a down payment. The higher the down payment, the lower the amount of the loan and the lower your monthly payments.
	- I knew I didn’t want to pay more than $400 per month on a car loan.
	- $400 x 48 months = $19,200 total for the loan, including interest
	- This set up $20,000 as my absolute maximum number.
5. Once you’ve figured out what you want, do a Google search for “best [car] [year]” for the years you’re interested in. Articles should come up from Car & Driver Magazine, Kelley Blue Book, others. Examples: “Best manual hatchbacks 2015” + “Best manual hatchbacks 2016”
6. Make a list of all the cars you might be interested in. I knew I wanted a hatchback from the last 5 years, so my list looked like this:
	- Honda Fit
	* Mazda 3
	* Nissan Versa Note
	* Subaru Impreza
	* VW Golf
5. For each car on your list, go to the manufacturer’s website for that car and find the “models and specs” or “trim levels” for that car. For example, this is what the page looks like for the Honda Fit: [2018 Honda Fit – The 5-Door Car with Attitude | Honda](https://automobiles.honda.com/fit). Look at each trim level and determine which one has the things you identified in your list previously. For me, I knew I wanted a Honda Fit EX because that’s the one with a sunroof and a nice sound system, two things I cared about. Add the trim levels to your list of cars along with the average price (“starting at” from the manufacturer website).
	- NOTE: if you are looking at primarily older cars (>5 years old) the manufacturer website will not be the best source of this info. Check out Car & Driver or KBB for the trim levels and specs.
6. Buying vs leasing — decide at this point whether it makes more sense to buy a car vs lease a car. Buying is nice because you build equity and you outright own a vehicle, but leasing can be good too if you care about having a new car every couple years and don’t want to worry about maintenance. Depending on the amount of miles you drive per year and other factors, one may be more economical than the other — this article from Consumer Reports might be helpful in determining that ([Leasing vs. Buying a New Car - Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/buying-a-car/leasing-vs-buying-a-new-car/)). I decided I wanted to buy a car, so the rest of this document is about buying a car, but leasing can be a lot easier, relatively less negotiation, more straightforward, etc. There is no right answer, just what’s right for you!
7. Go on Craigslist and do a search for each car on your list. Be sure to refine the search for cars with “clean” titles — you can do this on the left side of the page. Individuals and dealers alike use CL to list their cars, so anything you might want will be on there. For each car, I like to sort the resulting list by price — it’s the best way to clearly see the duplicate listings and not put the same car down more than once. For each car, list the following (from the CL ad):
	- price
	- location (dealership, address)
	- odometer reading (mileage)
	- year
	- color (it’s helpful when you go to test drive)
	- other info you care about — does it have a backup camera, cruise control, a sunroof, etc.
8. At this point, I decided that I didn’t want to buy from an individual but from a dealership. You can definitely buy a car from an individual and still finance through a bank, but I decided that I wanted to finance through a dealership for convenience/ease. I also decided that I wanted to work with a major/brand name dealership instead of a used car dealer because the used car dealers made me personally feel creepy. That is totally personal preference, but it’s something to think about.
9. Spend a day (or a few hours if you’re me) going out and test driving the cars. I’d pick one of each make/model for this first trip. This first outing should be purely investigative — go in knowing you will NOT buy a car today, no matter how much anyone tries to sell you. If you go to a dealership, the salesman will probably ask you what else you’re test driving that day and try to convince you why you shouldn’t or that they have something comparable etc etc — remember that you don’t have to tell them anything. It’s going to feel rude, but it’s the best way to own your own process. “I’m not sure yet” is a totally acceptable answer for any question they ask, and you can leave at any time. They’ll give you a card — if you like them, keep it and ask for them the next time you go in. If not, don’t worry about it.
10. After you drive each car, take some time away from the salesman with your partner to talk about what you liked and didn’t like about it. Write that down. Test driving a bunch of cars can be a frazzling experience and you won’t remember everything you felt at the time, so writing it down will help you assess later.
11. If you’re feeling tired or worn out but you haven’t gotten through your list for the day, that’s okay! Take a break and add another day of searching onto your process. I could only get through 2 a day because the process was anxiety inducing for me, and it was better that I stopped and divided the process over a few days. Your mileage may vary.
12. After you’ve narrowed it down to the main make/model or two that you’re interested in, do another Craigslist search (new cars will have been added since you last looked) and make another list of the cars you want to see that are the make/model you want. When I organized this second (well for me it was like the fifth) trip, I made sure to drive the one I was most interested in FIRST, drove a few others to make sure, then went back to the first one again. That was the one I ended up buying.
13. Sweet, you picked your car! Now is the time to return to thinking about how you’re going to pay for it. Some things to consider:
	- Do you want to finance through a dealership, or do you want to secure an auto loan ahead of time? Many banks and credit unions have auto loan specialists and can pre-qualify you for a loan of a certain amount. This is helpful particularly if you’re going to non-branded used car dealerships, because you have your number walking in and you can ignore their finance pitch. You also may be able to get a deal through your bank — look into this.
	- If you decide to go the dealer-financing route, there are sometimes awesome sales you can take advantage of. I ended up with 0.9% financing because my car was certified pre-owned and I happened to be there on the last day of a promotion.
14. I have no experience with bank financing, so the rest of this will be about doing financing at the dealership. This is how it went:
	1. The salesman (Andy) sat me down and gave me a sheet of paper showing my monthly payment on different types of loans with typical interest rates. The salesman’s goal at this point is to get you to sign a piece of paper that if you can get a price of $X, you will drive the car off the lot _today_.
	2. I don’t like negotiating (it drove my boyfriend crazy) so I just came in assuming I was going to be paying the amount of money they were selling the car for ($17,444). I signed this pretty quickly. One other time I got to the sitting-down part of this process, I sort of arbitrarily picked a total number and wouldn’t budge on it. The salesman couldn’t get down to that number and we walked away, but not before he had to go “talk to his manager and see what he could do”. The salesman is trying to get you to sign the piece of paper, so ultimately he’s on your side when he is talking to the finance side of the house — he’s trying to talk them down while talking you up to get to an agreement. It’s a super interesting process, but not really fun for me.
	3. Once you sign that magical piece of paper, the rest of the paperwork starts. The salesman will walk you through some of it, run your credit score, etc etc and eventually he will shovel you off to the money folks. The next person you talk to will be someone from the Financing Department — you’ve already committed to buying the car, now he’s going to try to upsell you on some additional features. Tire insurance, clear coat shield, tinted windows, various other bells and whistles that they can charge you more for. Some of these are not a bad call, depending on the situation. Look up “gap insurance” ahead of time and you’ll get a sense of what this kind of looks like.
	4. This is also the person who will be submitting your paperwork to the DMV on your behalf. Oh, yeah — when you buy a car through a dealership, they deal with the DMV for you! You sign lots and lots of paperwork and get lots of yellow and pink pieces of paper that you should keep.
15. When I signed the last piece of paper, the car was waiting for me with a trip permit for three months — they give the DMV lots of time to get your stuff to you.
